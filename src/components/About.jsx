                <p className="p-text-color">Hello there! I'm Shaz and thank you for visiting my site! I'm a junior software developer having recently graduated from CodeClan's 16-week intensive Professional Software development course. I have a background in healthcare, having previously worked as a Physiotherpist. I changed careers as I love the problem solving aspect of programming and the creavity you can bring to the projects you create. During my time at CodeClan I experienced over 800 hours of hands-on coding experience, learning the fundamentals of development in Python, Javascript and Java. I am eager to expand on my newfound knowledge as I enter the tech industry.
